          <h1>Why does it <span class="pink">Work?</span></h1>

          <p>
            Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a
            probiotic is not simply the sum of its individual components actions
            but the result of a complex network of relationships between the
            microorganisms it contains and the human host. Unlike many other
            products on the market, the clinical results obtained from
            CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.
            <br /><br />

            CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their
            biochemical and enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in
            precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the
            human gastrointestinal tract.
            <br /><br />
            It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione
            De Simone falls within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the
            bacteria forming the product s base are living organisms. Their
            cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific
            know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.

            <br /><br />
            The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De
            Simone, which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to
            the uniqueness and efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely
            difficult for others to replicate or produce an identical or
            functionally equivalent product. Supported by solid scientific
            evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary
            management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions,
            offering proven and replicable clinical results.

        <p>
          CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis,
          contributing to well-being in cases of intestinal disorders connected
          to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.
        </p>
        <h3>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</h3>
        <p>
          Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of
          microorganisms in the intestine is altered, causing various
          gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for
          maintaining digestive health, improving patient comfort, and
          contributing to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic
          intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative
          colitis, and pouchitis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h3>
        <p>
          CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of
          intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the severity and duration of
          symptoms, improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is
          particularly indicated for supporting intestinal health and can be
          beneficial in cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders
          characterized by accelerated transit that prevents normal daily
          activities or adequate night rest.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Variety of Dosages:</h3>
        <p>
          Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal
          health and adapt to individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to
          healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Original Formulation:</h3>
        <p>
          DS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique
          combination of proprietary bacterial strains designed to maximize
          intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in
          proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and
          consistency in every production.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Guaranteed Safety:</h3>

        <p>
          Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety.
          Thanks to a short supply chain approved by the inventor, the product
          maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to
          packaging.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Affordability:</h3>
        <p>
          CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing
          equivalent quantities of bacteria. Efficient production and direct
          cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market

        </h1>
        <p>
          The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of
          pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who
          redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing
          the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically
          manage acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. His interest in
          the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance
          of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood.
          Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of
          Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery,
          specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology.
          He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L'Aquila (Italy).
          He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and
          book chapters. Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone
          Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for
          better regulation and quality control of probiotics, highlighting the
          potential health and well-being risks. As emphasized by Professor De
          Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed
          probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to
          the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing
          substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final
          product (De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16
          No. 9 2018). Current regulations often do not require thorough
          comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes
          do not compromise the efficacy and safety of the commercially
          distributed probiotic product.

        <p>
          The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to
          modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a
          threat to public trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF)
          was sold under the brand name VSL#3®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and
          Actial Srl.
          <br /><br />
          In 2019, VSL#3® distributors were found guilty of false advertising
          (for more information:<span class="underline"
            >Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
            VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya).</span
          >
          Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has
          updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references
          to VSL#3® exclusively refer to DSF (<span class="underline"
            >ECCO, ECCO News, 2023</span
          >). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
          Metabolism) published the article
          <span class="underline"
            >“Clarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case
            of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3®</span
          >“, which reiterates the above. <br />
          <br />
          The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name “Visbiome in
          the USA and Canada (Exegi) and under the brand name De Simone
          Formulation in Korea (HectoHealthcare). <br /><br />
